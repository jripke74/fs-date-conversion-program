# fs-date-conversion-program

Build a Date Conversion Program
In this lab, you will code a date conversion program that converts a given date to different formats. For example, the current date Fri Sep 27 2024 16:04:43 GMT+0500 (Pakistan Standard Time) would be formatted in the following 2 ways:

(MM/DD/YYYY): 9/27/2024.
(Month Day, Year): September 27, 2024.
Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

1.  You should create a variable named currentDate and assign it the current date and time using the Date object.
2.  You should create a variable named currentDateFormat and assign it the string Current Date and Time: [current date]. Replace [current date] with the result of the currentDate variable.
3.  You should log the value of currentDateFormat to the console.
4.  You should create a function named formatDateMMDDYYYY that takes the date object as a parameter. You can name this parameter whatever you like.
5.  Your formatDateMMDDYYYY function should convert the current date to month/day/year format and return the string 6.Formatted Date (MM/DD/YYYY): [month]/[day]/[year].
6.  You should create a function named formatDateLong that takes the date object as a parameter.
7.  Your formatDateLong function should convert the current date to Month Day, Year format and return the string Formatted Date (Month Day, Year): [formatted date].

Note: For the tests to pass, make sure that you use en-US for the locale when formatting the dates.
